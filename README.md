# »Who wants to be a millionaire« game made with vue.js for moodle
This is a game plugin for Moodle. It can be added to any Moodle course. After that you will have to define levels 
and assign categories to each level. The game frontend is written with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) so that playing
the game doesn't require any page reloads.

# Special thanks
Integrating Vue.js into a moodle plugin was done by Martin Gauk from TU Berlin.

# Frontend with Vue.js
The javascript files and Vue components will be bundled to a single file as AMD module
`amd/build/app-lazy.min.js` using **Webpack**.
You may call functions in that module with `$PAGE->requires->js_call_amd`.

[The suffix -lazy is used to tell Moodle that the file should not be bundled with Moodle's
other AMD modules](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Javascript_Modules#But_I_have_a_mega_JS_file_I_don.27t_want_loaded_on_every_page.3F)
That makes sense because the javascript file generated by Webpack is quite big
and is only needed for this plugin.

If you want to change the Vue components or the javascript code, you have to install
all dependencies:
```
cd vue
npm install
```

With `npm run dev` or `npm run watch` you build the file `amd/build/app-lazy.min.js`
(in development mode) that will be loaded by the browser. Watch does not exit, it will
re-build the file whenever one of the source files was touched.

**Important: Before a commit** you should build the file with `npm run build` (production mode).
This generates a much smaller file. However, the file is not suitable for debugging using the
browser web developer tools.

Hint: you should disable Moodle's javascript cache. You may add the line `$CFG->cachejs = false;`
to `config.php`. If you disable caching, Moodle takes the file from the `amd/src` folder.
Hence, there is a symbolic link to `../build/app-lazy.min.js`.

If you want to use javascript libraries from Moodle, you have to declare them as external
dependencies in `vue/webpack.config.js` under `exports.externals`.
